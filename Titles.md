# What to Expect
Here's the gist of what to expect for each title.
## Junior
* Makes _no_ impact.
* "I need help."
* No experience.
## Midlevel
* Makes _product_ impact.
* "I don't need help."
* Few years of experience.
## Senior
* Makes _team_ impact.
* "How can I help?"
* 5-10 years of experience.
## Staff
* Makes _org_ impact.
* "Go help."
* 10-20 years of experience.
# Detailed Requirements
## Staff Software Engineer (L6)
* Typically having strategic impact over some combination of a large work group, a very technically challenging problem, and/or a long time horizon
* L6 influences velocity of team, mentorship, 10-30 engineers
* Solving large scale projects that involve the leadership in company
* Complexity: 1-2 year projects; balances multiple, interlocking risks (e.g., privacy and features), often many stakeholders
* Often delegates digging into low-level details to others, except in specific cases of substantial risk
* Proactively anticipate scaling issues and simplifying complex problems (i.e. simplify and standardize existing solutions, increase availability and reliability, or make data-driven optimizations and adjustments.)
* Often leading efforts across multiple teams in order to tackle problems at this scale with leadership involvement
* Drives product strategy, leads design discussions, collaborates with other engineering team's coding 50%
* Drives efforts across a sizable product group providing clear leadership via setting strategy, resolving disagreements and building consensus
* Broader leadership across multiple teams
* Technical Expertise: In design/code reviews, may suggest radically different options informed by and impacting other areas.

## Senior Software Engineer (L5)
* Technical direction for small number of engineers (0-5+)
* Leads design and provides constant day-to-day mentorship on technical direction for team
* Complexity: 1-2 quarter projects; mitigates against single risks at a time (e.g., capacity)
* Craftsmanship: Often digs into low-level details, especially in code
* Scope of Work: Owns immediate area, self-directs, but also plans and scopes larger scale projects
* Sphere of influence: Sets direction for a small number of engineers
* 1-2 relatively narrowly scoped technical focus areas
* Technical Expertise: In design/code reviews, provides guidance about how to solve a problem. Which option is best?
