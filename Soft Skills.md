# Soft Skills
Life lessons in communication I had to learn the hard way.
## Understand first, then be understood
Starting a dialogue with a disagreement just makes people dig their heels in. Try to understand first and let the person speak their thoughts, even if their thoughts are moronic. Let them be heard so they don't feel dismissed, especially if their title is above yours. Then try to convince them not by just telling them your opinion, but by asking them questions.
## Force others to own mistakes
"A failure to adequately plan on their part does not constitute an emergency on our part."
## Luck is preparation meets opportunity
## Use SBI
If you're uncomfortable giving feedback, use the [SBI](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/) framework.
