# Emergency Prep
[This family](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43iyip/our_family_of_5_lost_everything_in_a_fire/cziljy3) lost everything in a house fire. Great reference for lessons learned.

[This man](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ips9m5/comment/g4m51ei/) has been evacuated 4 times in 7 years and experienced a total loss.

take photos/video of everything. Open cupboards. Dig into closets.

Make a shared iPhone note with plans: a 5 min notice plan, 15 min notice, 60 min notice, etc. what would you take if you only had 5 mins? Personally, I’d grab sturdy shoes, meds, laundry basket with your clothes (since they’re most likely to be the things you wear often), computer, anything that is ABSOLUTELY irreplaceable (not stuff like birth certificates, but stuff that you simply can not replace). We also have a red zippered binder we call the “in case we get hit by a bus” binder that includes printouts of account statements, copies of critical documents, and so on. We update it yearly. It also holds the safe keys. The safe is fireproof so I’m not worried about it. I found a free template online that I used. Everything is backed up online also. (This is also for our kids guardians should something happen to my husband and I). Then expand to 15, 60, etc.

Make sure pets are locked in a room where they can be easily loaded into crates. Make sure they have collars on and leashes are accessible (harnesses are much better for this scenario)

Check your home or renters insurance policies.

Fill up your cars and point them outward. Park away from trees or bushes.

Have some petty cash on hand

Charge your phones and any backup batteries you have.

If you have kids, grab a comfort item for them and put it in the car now. Hell, I’d do it for adults also. There is nothing like a favorite blanket or pillow when you’re evacuated.

Load up the car sooner rather than later. It takes awhile and you do NOT want to be stuck with the 5 min option only.

Edit to add: Part of our 15 min plan is to grab black backpacks we have packed for each member of the family (pets included). We update them yearly. Those include fresh socks and underwear, 2 outfits, old sneakers (adults), basic toiletries, pet supplies, basic first aid, basic cleaning / cooking supplies.

Eta2: after the total loss, people came from every direction to help. The community support was really amazing. Everyone was willing to donate clothing, food, gift cards, baby supplies, etc. so I’d worry less about taking that type of thing and more about the irreplaceables.

Eta3 another tip I’ve heard, but haven’t done, is to throw waterproof stuff in a pool. So, if you have China you want to save but can’t fit, put it in a pool. It is more likely to survive.


The last thing I load is chain saw and bolt cutters, so I can get to them easily if a tree falls in my path out or I come upon a liked gate.

+1 on the chainsaw, whenever things get dicey, I’m bringing a chainsaw and a tow rope. Doesn’t take much to make a road impassable.

If you have pets, try to pack a bit for them. Doggy waste bags, toys, a blanket or two, a box of cat litter, treats, chew toys, bags of food. I see the things people are requesting from the evac sites in Santa Cruz and a lot of people find they need a lot of pet stuff. This stuff adds up and can be expensive to buy, too, so it makes financial sense if you have the space in your car.

Yeah for sure. Part of our 15 min plan is to grab black backpacks we have packed for each member of the family (pets included). Those include fresh socks and underwear, 2 outfits, basic toiletries, pet supplies, basic first aid, basic cleaning / cooking supplies.

Even if you load up your car, make sure the most important things are where you can grab them out in a 5-minute scenario. No guarantee you'll be able to take your car, if they have to get you some other way, you'll want to be able to get your most important papers and stuff in a hurry.

Also make sure you have a first aid kit ready to go.

Jewelry, irreplaceable heirlooms, items of extreme extreme sentimental or monetary value, cash. You should have IDs such as driver license and passport on hand. You should keep digital copies of your birth certificate, kids’ birth certs, social security cards, medical info, insurance policies, car registration/pink slip, etc. on a flash drive or portable hard drive. You could upload some of the less sensitive paperwork to the cloud for ease of access. But modern paperwork is generally re-accessible. Physical items such as heirloom jewelry are not replaceable.

Keep a red file. Binder with tabs - house , finance, personal, medical, vehicles. Copies of any important documents that fit any of those categories that you’d need to start rebuilding your life if you have to. Even Think of things like applying for new jobs (education, resume, certifications, etc) if necessary. Probably overkill for most emergencies but in the event of a huge, mega disaster, where you may need to be permanently relocated, it might give you a leg up. Include back and front photos of your credit cards so after your missing wallet burns up, you can still order pizza online at the motel room you’ve relocated to a couple hundred miles away.

Just one binder you can grab on the way out the door - even if it’s just a small disaster. It will have everything you might need.

Also- Keep an overnight bag in the car just in case you are away from home and can’t get back to your home. If possible, add spare medications. I know that’s not the case here, but it can, and has, happened.

Keeping an "oh shit" bag in my car has saved me on a handful of occasions. Even something as simple as having a toothbrush or 20$ can turn a bad night around.

You want ID (drivers license, passport, school ID) for the whole family. Your marriage certificate, birth certificates, divorce decree. Mortgage info, deed for the house, title for the cars. Proof of insurance- home, auto, life, health. A recent tax return. If you have to start over because your home burns, you need proof of who you are and that you owned that particular house. It will be a bit easier to sign up for any benefits or loans with this info.

My house burned in 2018. Make sure you record any nice trim you have, fixtures, fancy windows, roofing upgrades, heat pumps, attic fans, smart home devices, and things like that. Receipts from home upgrades are great. The first night I didn't have my phone, medicine, clothes, a toothbrush, or other necessities but I did salvage my purse at least. We were lucky to have a supportive community around us that donated almost everything we needed, clothes, toiletries, kids stuff, shoes, food, etc. We also had good insurance, so that helped. It took about 9 months from the fire to move back in to the house, which seemed much bigger with no furniture!

I worked in insurance and now work in Emergency response (not in the USA).

- Turn your camera to video and video your house. open every cupboard, every drawer and film. You will be surprised how quickly you will forget the items you owned.

- Have a go bag for every member of the house and any pets. Include food, water, medications, a change of clothing and any important documents (passport/insurance info/ID) DON'T FORGET YOUR PHONE CHARGER.

- Cash. Have cash.

- Fill your vehicle with fuel

- Have a plan. Make sure everyone in the house knows the plan. Where will you go? How long will you stay there? Where is your back up location? Where will you meet if separated?

- Leave early. Bushfires make roads impassable, and they close roads to allow airbombing. Leave early and go far. More people die on the roads than in homes during bushfires because they get trapped with nowhere to go.

Wishing you and your family all the best. Take care and stay safe. Remember - its just stuff, stuff can be replaced. People can't.

List of logins/passwords if you keep a physical copy somewhere
IT computer guy here... use a cloud password vault. There are many with high grade security and encryption. I use one for my wife and I. Set a family member as a recovery contact incase of being hit by a bus.

I helped a friend whose husband passed away from cancer. He had everything prepared and all access to online accounts were in the vault which made life easier for her.

Oh, and when you're gassing up the car and making sure you have extra water and wiper fluid in the car - buy a paper map at the gas station.

If you're dealing with jammed cell phone towers and no wi-fi access, you'll appreciate having a paper alternative to your cell phone or gps.

Mark off the main evacuation routes, evacuation shelters, and hotels that allow pets.

shutoff electric and gas service at your home disconnect. water service..probably as well. dont thing broken pipes will extinguish but if it approachs awau from the service line you may limit damage. drain and bleed them as well so nk trapped gas or water

entertainment

Hey man, this doesn't answer your question, but I live in a fire prone area and this is my checklist I keep handy on my phone. It's ordered in terms of importance, so I can go down through the list and grab what's most important depending on how much time I have.

Phone/wallet/keys

Masks

Phone charger

Cash

[Specific location of your birth certificate/passport/important documents]

[Medicine, yours and your family members']

Backpack [bug-out bag pre loaded with battery packs, cables, snacks, pen/paper, pocket knife, cash, towels, bottled water, change of clothes, etc]

Pet food / food & water bowl

Water gallons

Family photos

Laptop/expensive electronics

First aid kit

TO DO BEFORE LEAVING:

Close all doors and windows

Take BBQ propane tank away from home [this is a danger to firemen who may be going in to save your house]

Take down window shades [these are flammable and also block out light firemen may need to navigate your house]

Leave all lights on [helps firemen navigate your house]

Close all doors [prevents fire from spreading easily between rooms]

Turn off air conditioning [so it doesn't circulate oxygen and fuel fire]

Take photos of everything [for insurance reasons]

EVAC MEETUP SPOTS: [for yourself, family, and friends; have multiple with different routes]

[location 1]

[location 2]

[location 3]

Also, during this time of the year make sure you keep the gas in your car full. Last time I evacuated, I had been procrastinating on filling up and I ended up in a 2 mile line of bumper - to - bumper traffic in the only way out, on almost empty. What I learned is, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FIGURING THINGS OUT ON THE FLY IN A PANIC SITUATION. No matter how prepared you are in your head when things are calm, when the crap hits the fan your "disaster time quick plans" are just not as well thought-out as your "calm time rational plans". Especially with panicked, screaming pets/children in the car. Stay prepared.

And - pack up sooner rather than later. Both times I evac'd, we started packing as soon as the fire was within a few miles. And then, by the time you must leave, you are not panicking trying to do the last few things when the fire is bearing on you. When it's an emergency like a fire, DON'T BE AFRAID TO LOOK AFRAID. And what I mean is, I feel silly packing up when my neighbors are just leaning on the fence gaily looking on the fire - but, if it turns bad, you want to have the luxury of being the first one out. Unpacking sucks, but being prepared in the midst of a disaster situation is a million times better.

It's a scary time we're having and I've had to evac my house two times in the past five years. Luckily, both times I had 3-6 hours between "oh it looks like the fire is headed this way" to "okay I'm being told to evacuate". Here's to hoping it's not a third time this year. I live in CA so if you have any questions at all please ask, I love to share my knowledge and resources.

# Insurance Claim

[How to make an insurance claim the right way](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43iyip/our_family_of_5_lost_everything_in_a_fire/cziljy3/?st=jydwu07d&sh=e47cf961)

Hey OP... I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house. The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters. I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.

Our goal was to use the information you provided, and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.

For instance, if all you say was "toaster" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time. And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned. We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were. We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote. To further that example:

If you said "toaster - $25" , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.
If you said "toaster- $200" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)
If you said "toaster, from Walmart" , you're getting that $4.88 one.
If you said "toaster, from Macys" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.
If you said "toaster", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.
If you said "Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9", you just got yourself $9.
If you said "High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button" ... you might get $35-50 instead. We had to match all features that were listed.
I'm not telling you to lie on your claim. Not at all. That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim). But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time. Pay attention to those last two examples.

I remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder. Worth like $5 at a scrap yard. It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy strongly insisted that we replace with "Like Kind And Quality" (trigger words). Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies). $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.

Remember to list fucking every -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of. For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:

Designer Shower Curtain - $35
Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15
Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15
Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35
Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15
Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19
Holder for Loofahs - $20
Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)
Bath bomb - from Lush - $12
High end shampoo - from salon - $40
High end conditioner - from salon - $40
Refining pore mask - from salon - $55
I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower. Nothing there is "unreasonable" , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake. The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned. No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through. The adjuster has other shit to do, too.

Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (it's just some used soap and sponges..) -- and those people would be losing out on $400.

Some things require documentation & ages. If you say "tv - $2,000" -- you're getting a 32" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts. Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.

If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house. Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook. Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you think you purchased from Restoration Hardware. Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.

The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value. You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut. But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up "creatively" for the insurance company to process.

Sometimes people would come back to us with "updated* claims. They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like "toaster", "microwave", "tv" .. and weren't happy with what they got back. So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with "more information." I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated. (It's amazing what can happen when people suddenly "remember" their entire wardrobe came from Nordstrom.)

# Medical
## Wet to Dry Bandage
It’s part of a wet to dry bandage. I will use Manuka honey with wet gauze (the gauze should be sterile and damp with sterile saline then wrung out). I put the honey or sugar directly into the wound bed then the damp gauze then dry gauze then cast padding then cling then vet wrap (since I’m only ever bandaging animals). The bandage should be changed every 12-48 hrs (usually every 24 hrs) and I also have my patients on antibiotics usually.

Once the wound has healthy granulation tissue the bandage type changes because daily bandage changes with a wet to dry bandage also provide mechanical debridement of the wound but once it is healthy tissue we don’t want to be debriding it. There are newer products that provide a moist environment without leading to mechanical debriding at bandage change but they are much less likely to be available. 

Basically if you have a big gross, infected wound you should clean it out and then put honey/sugar on/in then a damp layer then a dry layer and keep it wrapped up, changing it daily. Once it isn’t gross and infected you can stop the honey/sugar and use something like hydrogel or calcium alginate or If you don’t have that (bc those are fancy and maybe prescription) change to a non adherent bandage with triple antibiotic ointment or even just Vaseline to keep the area protected while it finishes healing. 

Manuka honey is best; natural antibiotic
