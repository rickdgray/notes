# Watermelon Salad
## Details
| Cook Time | Yield | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20 min | 1 large bowl | 4-6 |

## Ingredients
* Large watermelon
* 2 scallions
* 2 serrano peppers
* 1/3 cup fresh squeezed lime juice
* 1-2 tbsp sugar
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup of crumbled cotija cheese
* 1/4 cup chopped, salted, roasted pepitas
* 1/4 cup cilantro

## Directions
1. Chop and slice the bottoms of the scallions. Chop the greens and save for later.
2. Split, deseed and chop the serrano peppers.
3. Mix the scallions, serrano peppers, and lime juice to create a dressing.
4. Let sit and meld while cutting melon.
5. Cut the melon into 1.5 inch cubes.
6. Taste the melon for sweetness:
	1. If watermelon is sweet, add 1 tbsp of sugar to the dressing.
	2. If not very sweet, add 2 tbsp instead.
7. Add 3/4 tsp salt to the dressing.
8. Toss melon chunks in the dressing.
9. Add to salad the cotija cheese, pepitas, cilantro, and chopped scallion greens from earlier.

## Notes
Wash your hands after mixing! Lime juice is a solvent and will dissolve the capsaicin into your skin. It will make your hands _burn_ and it will last for days.
Watermelon is all water so you can't add oil like a typical dressing; to compensate the lack of richness, we use cheese and nuts instead.
