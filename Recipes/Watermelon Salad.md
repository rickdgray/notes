## Ingredients
* 6 cups of melon or so, maybe half a melon
* 2 scallions
* 2 serranos
* 1/3 cup lime juice
* 1-2 tbsp sugar
* 3/4 tsp salt

## Directions
1. Mix scallions, serranos, and lime juice
2. Let sit for 5 min
3. Cut melon into 1.5 inch cubes
4. Taste for sweetness
5. If sweet add 1 tbsp of sugar to lime juice mix
6. If not so sweet add 2 tbsp
7. Add 3/4 tsp salt
8. Toss melon in dressing
9. Add 1/2 cup of crumbled cotija cheese
10. Add 1/4 cup chopped salted roasted pepitas
11. Add 1/4 cup cilantro
12. Add scallion greens from earlier

## Notes
Wash your hands after mixing. Lime juice is a solvent and will dissolve the capsaicin and will make your hands _burn_ and it will last for days.
Watermelon is all water so you can't add oil; to compensate the lack of richness, we use cheese and nuts.
