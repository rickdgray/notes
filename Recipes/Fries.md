# Fries
## Details
| Cook Time | Yield | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 minutes active (+ freezing time) | About 4 cups | 4 |

## Ingredients
* 1.5 pounds petite potatoes
* Kosher salt (for blanching water and seasoning)
* Neutral oil for frying (canola, avocado, or peanut oil)
* Optional: cornstarch or potato starch for light dusting

## Directions
1. **Prep the Potatoes**:  
   Wash and scrub the petite potatoes well. Cut them into quarters (or smaller if very large).

2. **Blanch**:  
   Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the cut potatoes and blanch for 3–5 minutes, until just beginning to soften but still firm. Immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop cooking.

3. **Dry Thoroughly**:  
   Drain and pat the potatoes completely dry with clean towels.

4. **Freeze**:  
   Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Freeze uncovered until solid (about 2–3 hours). Once frozen, transfer to a vacuum-sealed bag and seal. Store in freezer until ready to fry.

5. **First Fry**:  
   Heat ⅛ to ¼ inch of neutral oil in a heavy cast iron skillet to 325°F (163°C). Add frozen potatoes in a single layer. Fry for 3–4 minutes without moving them, until pale golden. Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.

6. **Second Fry**:  
   Increase oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Fry the pre-cooked potatoes again for 1–2 minutes until deeply golden and crispy.

7. **Season and Serve**:  
   Immediately season hot fries with kosher salt. Serve right away.

## Notes
* Using a vacuum sealer helps prevent freezer burn and keeps the potatoes dry and crisp when frying later.
* A light dusting of cornstarch before frying (optional) can add even more crunch.
* Avoid overcrowding the pan to ensure even browning and crispiness.
* No need to thaw the potatoes before frying.
* Best enjoyed fresh and hot!
