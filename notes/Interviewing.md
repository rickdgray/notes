# Questions for the Interviewer
1) **How do you feel the company rewards achievement?**
This is my favorite question because it seems to produce a different reaction every time, sometimes with them squirming uncomfortably.
   - Some interviewers will give a generic bullshit answer: there are no rewards. This is OK at best, but if everything else is good including salary, I'll move forward.
   - Many interviewers are caught off guard because they don't immediately have a great answer and have to think about it: there are no rewards, and also the interviewer sucks. I'm slightly less likely to take this opportunity seriously.
   - Some interviewers even react poorly as if they believe employees should not be asking about rewards: bad attitude, definitely don't waste any more time.
   - Rarely, the interviewer will be able to list off great programs and incentives for employees who succeed without even having to think about it: If the programs include getting your name mentioned at the next townhall meeting, fine answer. If the incentive is some kind of payout, great answer.
2) **How do you like your job?**
Another favorite of mine. It's just a good question in general. Pay close attention to their expressions and eyes. Everybody always answers that they like it; that's just being cordial. Their face will give you the real answer.
3) **Do you believe that there'll be more upside once you join?**
In other words, I want more money. Will salaries go up? Will the company IPO and realize your equity, etc.? Remember that if a company with 500m funding gets 1b funding next, unless shares are diluted, your equity effectively doubled.
4) **How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings?**
All meetings is tough as you're effectively tied to your screen. Medium amount can be OK because you at least have an excuse if you don't get a ton accomplished. None is also good *as long as their expectations are low*.
5) **How flexible is the schedule if I need to run errands, as long as I'm getting my work done?**
This is obvious. It's a round about way of asking, "are you going to micromanage me?" and "Is there a culture here of being able to just not work on the clock for a while and no one cares?"
6) **What is the team's cadence?**
What's the general day to day communication look like? Do people often ping and chat with each other or do pair programming? Are people going to notice if I step out?
7) **How large is the team?**
A large team means work is diluted a lot. A small team means you end up in a "wear many hats" situation.
8) **What are your thoughts on asynchronous work?**
You can literally be gone during the day and have a valid reason. "I work best in the afternoon."
9) **Does the team prioritize meetings or documentation?**
Talking all day and never writing anything down is just an "all talk, no walk" attitude. Documentation should always be utilized to prevent communicative overhead.
10) **Is there an expectation of cameras on during meetings?**
This is more of a preference. I like cameras on.
11) **How does the team minimize disruptions?**
A polite way of saying "I want to be left alone for the most part so I can just get work done."
12) **How does the team get solid focus time in?**
Same as above
13) **What project methodology does your team use?**
Fuck waterfall. It implies deadlines. Agile means "what gets done gets done ðŸ¤·" More conducive to taking your time and low stress.
14) **How does the workload break down between meetings, collaborative work and solo work?**
Probing directly for info on paired work. And also if there's a lot of meetings.
15) **What is your leadership style?**
Will you micromanage me?
16) **What keeps you up at night about this job?**
Is it high stress?
17) **How do you normally propagate status updates to your managers and stakeholders?**
Do I have to answer to middle management directly or is that someone else's issue after we don't meet deadlines.
18) **What is your meeting culture like, and how do employees handle things like zoom fatigue?**
Are we gonna be glue to the damn camera for 8 hours a day and if there's a lot of meetings, are employees allowed to say "fuck, I need a break" and not attend some?
