<h1 id="questions-for-the-interviewer">Questions for the Interviewer</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do you feel the company rewards achievement?</strong>
This is my favorite question because it seems to produce a different reaction every time, sometimes with them squirming uncomfortably.
<ul>
<li>Some interviewers will give a generic bullshit answer: there are no rewards. This is OK at best, but if everything else is good including salary, I&rsquo;ll move forward.</li>
<li>Many interviewers are caught off guard because they don&rsquo;t immediately have a great answer and have to think about it: there are no rewards, and also the interviewer sucks. I&rsquo;m slightly less likely to take this opportunity seriously.</li>
<li>Some interviewers even react poorly as if they believe employees should not be asking about rewards: bad attitude, definitely don&rsquo;t waste any more time.</li>
<li>Rarely, the interviewer will be able to list off great programs and incentives for employees who succeed without even having to think about it: If the programs include getting your name mentioned at the next townhall meeting, fine answer. If the incentive is some kind of payout, great answer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How do you like your job?</strong>
Another favorite of mine. It&rsquo;s just a good question in general. Pay close attention to their expressions and eyes. Everybody always answers that they like it; that&rsquo;s just being cordial. Their face will give you the real answer.</li>
<li><strong>Do you believe that there&rsquo;ll be more upside once you join?</strong>
In other words, I want more money. Will salaries go up? Will the company IPO and realize your equity, etc.? Remember that if a company with 500m funding gets 1b funding next, unless shares are diluted, your equity effectively doubled.</li>
<li><strong>How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings?</strong>
All meetings is tough as you&rsquo;re effectively tied to your screen. Medium amount can be OK because you at least have an excuse if you don&rsquo;t get a ton accomplished. None is also good <em>as long as their expectations are low</em>.</li>
<li><strong>How flexible is the schedule if I need to run errands, as long as I&rsquo;m getting my work done?</strong>
This is obvious. It&rsquo;s a round about way of asking, &ldquo;are you going to micromanage me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is there a culture here of being able to just not work on the clock for a while and no one cares?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>What is the team&rsquo;s cadence?</strong>
What&rsquo;s the general day to day communication look like? Do people often ping and chat with each other or do pair programming? Are people going to notice if I step out?</li>
<li><strong>How large is the team?</strong>
A large team means work is diluted a lot. A small team means you end up in a &ldquo;wear many hats&rdquo; situation.</li>
<li><strong>What are your thoughts on asynchronous work?</strong>
You can literally be gone during the day and have a valid reason. &ldquo;I work best in the afternoon.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Does the team prioritize meetings or documentation?</strong>
Talking all day and never writing anything down is just an &ldquo;all talk, no walk&rdquo; attitude. Documentation should always be utilized to prevent communicative overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Is there an expectation of cameras on during meetings?</strong>
This is more of a preference. I like cameras on.</li>
<li><strong>How does the team minimize disruptions?</strong>
A polite way of saying &ldquo;I want to be left alone for the most part so I can just get work done.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>How does the team get solid focus time in?</strong>
Same as above</li>
<li><strong>What project methodology does your team use?</strong>
Fuck waterfall. It implies deadlines. Agile means &ldquo;what gets done gets done ðŸ¤·&rdquo; More conducive to taking your time and low stress.</li>
<li><strong>How does the workload break down between meetings, collaborative work and solo work?</strong>
Probing directly for info on paired work. And also if there&rsquo;s a lot of meetings.</li>
<li><strong>What is your leadership style?</strong>
Will you micromanage me?</li>
<li><strong>What keeps you up at night about this job?</strong>
Is it high stress?</li>
<li><strong>How do you normally propagate status updates to your managers and stakeholders?</strong>
Do I have to answer to middle management directly or is that someone else&rsquo;s issue after we don&rsquo;t meet deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>What is your meeting culture like, and how do employees handle things like zoom fatigue?</strong>
Are we gonna be glue to the damn camera for 8 hours a day and if there&rsquo;s a lot of meetings, are employees allowed to say &ldquo;fuck, I need a break&rdquo; and not attend some?</li>
