It may be boring, but it will give you the background and reason why I say certain things later. This article is written for platter drives, although much, but not all, applies to the SSD drives too. There are surprisingly very few studies published on platter drive failures. Google did one, Backblaze has made several informative blog posts, and there was one published on usenix. But that\u0026amp;rsquo;s it other than some scattered forum postings. If there are any good studies on SSD drives, they are well hidden. What I have seen is mostly anecdotal stories which say, unlike plater drives, SSD drives tend to just up and die without warning. Firmware issues are responsible for some of those failures. I could find nothing on hybrid drives. S.M.A.R.T All modern drives have built in software built right into the drive\u0026amp;rsquo;s firmware for monitoring their health, known as Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology system, or SMART for short. It is designed to monitor the health and performance of the hard drive and help predict impending failure. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s also arguably the best tool for the job currently available. However, it is far from perfect. Google\u0026amp;rsquo;s mammoth hard drive study found about 40% of the failed drives had no indicators from SMART that the drive was bad1. Still a 60-63% chance of detecting a bad drive beats everything else out there and is therefore widely used. Technically, SMART is an optional part of the ATA standard, and some USB devices do not support SMART. Virtual disks do not support SMART either, although the physical disk(s) they are hosted on will. Hardware RAID controller support is hit or miss, although software RAID controllers generally do support SMART. SMART tools may not work on SCSI or SAS drives since they may not use ATA command sets.

The hard drive will have two types of sectors and it is easy …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"d7a0610b0c9fdcaf9d375a651ad4cc47","permalink":"https://rickdgray.github.io/notes/dev/hard-drive-testing/","title":"HDD Testing"},{"content":"Questions for the Interviewer How do you feel the company rewards achievement? This is my favorite question because it seems to produce a different reaction every time, sometimes with them squirming uncomfortably. Some interviewers will give a generic bullshit answer: there are no rewards. This is OK at best, but if everything else is good including salary, I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll move forward. Many interviewers are caught off guard because they don\u0026amp;rsquo;t immediately have a great answer and have to think about it: there are no rewards, and also the interviewer sucks. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m slightly less likely to take this opportunity seriously. Some interviewers even react poorly as if they believe employees should not be asking about rewards: bad attitude, definitely don\u0026amp;rsquo;t waste any more time. Rarely, the interviewer will be able to list off great programs and incentives for employees who succeed without even having to think about it: If the programs include getting your name mentioned at the next townhall meeting, fine answer. If the incentive is some kind of payout, great answer. How do you like your job? Another favorite of mine. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s just a good question in general. Pay close attention to their expressions and eyes. Everybody always answers that they like it; that\u0026amp;rsquo;s just being cordial. Their face will give you the real answer. Do you believe that there\u0026amp;rsquo;ll be more upside once you join? In other words, I want more money. Will salaries go up? Will the company IPO and realize your equity, etc.? Remember that if a company with 500m funding gets 1b funding next, unless shares are diluted, your equity effectively doubled. How many hours a week do you expect this role to spend in meetings? All meetings is tough as you\u0026amp;rsquo;re effectively tied to your screen. Medium amount can be OK because you at least have an excuse if you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t get a ton accomplished.

Does that number look familiar? It should. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s the max value for a 32 bit unsigned number.\nNow, imagine a binary tree. The root node represents ip addresses 0 through 4294967295, or 0.0.0.0 through 255.255.255.255. It is at level 0 of the binary tree.

A single chief architect (or a small number of architects), acting on the user\u0026amp;rsquo;s behalf, decides what goes in the system and what stays out. The architect or team of architects should develop an idea of what the system should do and make sure that this vision is understood by the rest of the team. A novel idea by someone may not be included if it does not fit seamlessly with the overall system design. In fact, to ensure a user-friendly system, a system may deliberately provide fewer features than it is capable of.
