title: Choose a License

* GPL
	- My default choice.
	- All derivatives must also have the same license! Prevents blatant theft of your work.
* MIT & BSD & ISC
	- Go crazy; no rules
* Apache 2
	-   [**Use the code commercially**](https://fossa.com/blog/which-open-source-license-is-the-best-for-commercialization/)**:** Companies can include the licensed code in proprietary software that they then sell to customers.
	-   **Alter the code:** Developers are permitted to make modifications to the original code.
	-   **Distribute any copies or modifications of the code:** An individual or organization is allowed to copy and/or update the code, then make that version available to others (even commercially).
	-   **Sublicense the code:** A company can distribute their reworked version of the code under a stronger license.
	-   **Use patent claims:** Under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, contributors to the code explicitly grant patent rights to users (although experts believe that the language of other permissive licenses also [grants such rights](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/how-make-sense-apache-2-patent-license?ref=fossa.com)).
	-   **Place warranty:** Users of the open source code can place a warranty on the licensed software.
